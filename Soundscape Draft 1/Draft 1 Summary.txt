The project as it sits now is only in its preliminary stage. The project is very bare-bones as of now, as it only 
contains 3-4 samples. 

For a summary of the project, the audio file details the part of the project before the conflict. The project 
details a scientist in a laboratory setting, just doing standard work. You can hear the electric hum of the 
instrumentation in the lab. You can also hear the scientist typing at a keyboard, recording data from the test 
subject, as well as the scientist turning a knob, as a means of altering the environment the test subject is in.

As of right now, the main thing preventing me from making anymore progress is just planning out everything that 
I want to include in the final draft of the project. I have a lot of ideas that I want to include in the overall
project, but I am afraid that the entire project will end up being bloated with so many samples and sounds, 
and even end up multiple minutes long.

For right now, my next plans are to record more samples, and find potential samples to use online. As a whole,
I want to use as many original samples as possible. I want to be responsible for making most of the sounds in the
project. As of right now, all of the samples present in the first draft are recorded by myself. The downside with
this approach is the extra time, planning, and consideration that comes along with it.

As of right now, my next plan is to focus on programming the sounds I want to use for other machinery and 
computational samples. I will be using MAX/MSP to program these sounds. Eventually, I will get to the point to
have a full draft by this upcoming Tuesday.
