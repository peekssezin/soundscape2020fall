# Reflection on Experimentation

### Nick Pekor

Within the first couple of days considering a theme for my soundscape, I found myself stuck. I didn't really find myself with a lot of motivation for the project. I felt like the environment I was around just didn't suit any kind of story I would want to pursue. The environment I found myself in left me with very little inspiration for the soundscape. I decided that I needed to rethink my approach to the soundscape project. Instead of putting myself into an environment, I created my own environment from scratch. I assumed that a majority of other's would tend to create stories in the realm of "normality", or to say that their stories would have a similar setting. With this thought, I decided that I wanted to pursue an ideas that would most likely not be done.

The soundscape project I created details a story about a scientist going into a lab, running tests on a test subject, and having a test fail, ultimately resulting in the test subject being freed from its containment. I fully decided on this idea because of previous experiences dealing with audio production and synthesis, and I felt that taking advantage of this previous experience could result in a unique soundscape.

I utilized two different audio interfaces to create the sounds I wanted to use. These were Famitracker, a program used to create music using 8-bit soundfonts, and MAX/MSP a music programming interface. I created the sounds made through famitracker from scratch, and I used a project I had created in a previous class to synthesize the glitching sound in MAX/MSP.

When it came to feedback, I honestly didn't know where to go next. Most of the feedback said my project was good, but none really critiqued my work and told me what to do better. Of course, I did do my best to proofread my project. I made different sounds fade into each other better, and I even added a title to the soundscape! (Making a title completely slipped my mind when doing this.)

 I also left myself until the final draft to create my citations for the samples used throughout the soundscape. I did this mainly because I felt it would be better to focus on fully fleshing out the soundscape and making it sound good before taking care of anything else.

 I do feel as if I had made a soundscape that met the baseline criteria, if not even more than that. I met all the minimum requirements, such as getting samples from various sources and citing correctly. I personally feel that the story also concludes in a good way. I also feel that I hit a lot of aspiration goals. I spent a lot of time in Audacity messing around with panning and volume shifting to get the sounds that would fit best in the setting I made, and I also experimented a lot with the sources of sound I recorded, such as making sounds artifically through audio interfaces and using amplifier feedback.

 Overall, I had a great time working on this project. Personally, I've been listening to a lot of music that incorporates the use of field recordings and sampling similar to what was done in the project. That kind of helped to jumpstart my work on the assignment.
