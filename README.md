#Title

The soundscape details a scientist going into a laboratory settings to perform tests on an isolated specimen. Somewhere along the line though, a test goes awry. The scientist tries to alleviate this error, but overall nothing works. The scientist then activates an emergency procedure to exterminate the test subject, but this is done in vain. The test subject breaks out of the containment chamber and lands on the floor, motionless, at least for now.
