# Experimentation
### By Nick Pekor



The soundscape details a scientist going into a laboratory settings to perform tests on an isolated specimen. Somewhere along the line though, a test goes awry. The scientist tries to alleviate this error, but overall nothing works. The scientist then activates an emergency procedure to exterminate the test subject, but this is done in vain. The test subject breaks out of the containment chamber and lands on the floor, motionless, at least for now.

Most of the sounds were created by me, with a couple of exceptions being retrieved from the internet. The personally recorded samples come from a multitude of sources, whether it be recording the surroundings, or even using a guitar amp and some guitar pedals to general artificial droning feedback. Multiple digital audio workspaces were also used to produce minimalistic sequenced tones.
